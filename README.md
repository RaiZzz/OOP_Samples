Project created for OOP samples, based on Java language, Maven, and TestNG Frameworks.

Main Information:

    1.main:
        1.1.Package "pages": contain description(links) of all web elements on the pages.
        1.2.Package "resource": contain all resources that help collaborate between Classes.
    2.test:
        2.1.Package "tests": for now contain just one test for the CrowdRise Web Site.

P.S. It's just a sample, not pretend to be a perfect.
